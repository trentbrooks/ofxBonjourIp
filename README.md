Bonjour sucks. This addon uses Bonjour just to find ip addresses of ios devices on the same network and that's it. Included is a server and client example.

Not setup for network comms- Bonjour streams are ugly. Use OSC, UDP or TCP instead (more OF friendly).

Currently ios, but osx version is on the way. Robotconscience has already done this here though... https://github.com/robotconscience/ofxBonjour
