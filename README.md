Bonjour sucks. This addon uses Bonjour just to find ip addresses of ios devices on the same network and that's it. Example broadcasts itself and looks for other devices. To test run example on your device (iphone/ipad) and in the simulator.

Not setup for network comms- Bonjour streams are ugly. Use OSC, UDP or TCP instead (more OF friendly).

Currently ios, but osx version is on the way. Robotconscience has already done this here though... https://github.com/robotconscience/ofxBonjour
